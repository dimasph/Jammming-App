# Codecademy React Practise Project: Jammming

## Introduction

In this project, I create a React web application called **Jammming**, which utilizes my expertise in React components, state, and requests, along with the Spotify API. This website enables users to search the Spotify library, create custom playlists, and save them to their Spotify account."

Additionally this web app is deployed with surge at [https://unleash-dev.surge.sh/](https://unleash-dev.surge.sh/)

## Features

**Spotify Login:** The first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, they will be prompted to log in or create a new account. The developer must follow the steps in the Spotify Developer Guide to register the application.

**Search by Song, Album, or Artist:** Users can enter the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library.

**Populate Results List:** Jammming will display a list of returned tracks from the user's query.

**Add Song to a Custom Playlist:** Users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.

**Remove Song from Custom Playlist:** Users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.

**Change Playlist Title:** Users can change the title of their custom playlist.

**Save Playlist to Account:** Users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button labeled "SAVE TO SPOTIFY."

## Resources

As the aim of this project was to practise on building the app using React, some resources such us HTML/CSS content and visual links were provided beforehand. However, during the project accomplishment it was required to create the file paths and component structure based on desired features.

## Conclusion

This is so far the most complex project I have taken throughout the process of learning web development. Once the features to be implemented were defined, and given that I start from the React template provided when running app from the CLI, I found really challenging to see (with no guidance) the numbers of components to be created, how they interact with each other, methods, states, set Spotify API and hook up to my app.

Given the above, it hugely helps me to extend my skills and be aware of how a large project is built.
